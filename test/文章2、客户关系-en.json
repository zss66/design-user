Once the customer's activity drops, it means the customer leaves or is lost. Based on this, the concept of \"retention\" can be used to analyze the service effect of an application or website and whether it can retain customers.

    "title_04": "Why customer retention strategies are important",
    "text_09": "Most people believe that customer retention is important because it means the business loses fewer customers than it would otherwise. But a sound retention strategy is actually one of the most powerful levers a company has to grow its business by creating loyal customers and building valuable customer relationships.",
    "text_10": "‚ÄúThe profit from retaining customers is more than twice the profit from acquiring new customers.‚Äù",
    "text_11": "A study from Priceintelligently showed that a 1% increase in the number of customers can affect your bottom line, but only by a little more than 3%. But improving your customer retention by reducing your total churn rate by 1% can extend your customer lifetime value and increase your ultimate profitability by about 7%. Therefore, it is concluded that the profit brought by retaining customers is more than twice the profit brought by acquiring new customers.",
    "text_12": "Not only that, the average spending level of those existing customers is 67% higher than that of new customers. They are also more likely to refer you to other customers, which is one of the most effective ways to acquire new customers. Research shows that the conversion rate of recommended new customers is 3-5 times that of other marketing channels. These new customers have a lifetime value of 16% and above, and a retention rate of 37% and above, so these new customers will be more valuable. .",

    "text_18": "One particularly effective retention strategy is lifecycle messaging. Lifecycle messaging involves contacting customers with contextual, personalized messages that provide value to customers based on their actual experiences using (or not using) the software. These messages are targeted and delivered across multiple channels, often as part of a carefully planned multi-channel campaign.",
    "text_19": "This means you can reach your customers where they are most likely to take action, whether within or outside your app or product. By engaging and engaging customers with the right message at the right time and place, businesses can improve customer satisfaction and increase the likelihood that they will stay.",
    "text_20": "Best of all, it doesn‚Äôt take a lot of effort to create these messaging schedules. All it takes to create a lightweight but effective customer retention program is a few hours of creating a simple campaign that will pay off in multiple ways‚Äîsuch as instilling a culture of retention marketing into every aspect of your business. Building relationships with these customers from day one and optimizing their experience is key to improving customer retention.",
    "title_05": "How to understand customer retention",

In this way, customer-facing teams can have a real impact on a business‚Äôs customer retention rates and can also help businesses detect and reduce churn before it happens.",

    "text_24": "1. Resist customer churn by shortening the time it takes to realize customer value.",
    "text_25": "The moment a company acquires a customer, the seeds of customer churn are sown. Even after product usage induction, everything about the product is still unfamiliar to customers, and companies should not expect new customers to solve their problems on their own. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to create a flawless customer experience from the first day of customer contact. By shortening time to customer value and helping customers find their answers. As long as you respond quickly enough, you can help them see an immediate return on their investment in your product or service, which means they are more likely to feel the impact of the product and stick with it.",
    "text_26": "\"Many people will be attracted to the one or two features of a product that resonate most with them, but they won't explore other features. This means they're missing out on some of the best parts of the product.\"",
    "text_27": "For example, many people will be attracted to the one or two features in a product that resonate most with them, but they won‚Äôt explore other features. This means they miss out on some of the best parts of the product. Those buying for the first time need to see the value the product provides them from the first step of the customer journey. Allowing them to use these features and discover new value in the first few days after signing up can be helpful in retaining customers.",
    "text_28": "Customer value can be explained in two ways:",
    "text_29": "The first is the value that the company provides to customers, that is, the value of the products and services provided by the company from the customer's perspective;",

    "text_34": "Invite customers to a webinar or demo: Highlight key workflows and concepts in their specific industry (we‚Äôve found that new customers who attend a webinar generate 6x more paid activations than new customers who don‚Äôt). Benefit: It also gives them the opportunity to ask questions that are unique to their business and receive more tailored advice from the business‚Äôs in-house experts.",
    "text_35": "Create a ‚Äúgetting started‚Äù guide: short, clear, and answer questions upfront about features they may be unfamiliar with. Proactively send targeted messages to customers, or as part of a multi-channel, multi-style product onboarding campaign, provide this guide to customers so they don‚Äôt even need to search to use it ‚Äì it‚Äôs right there, Ready to use.",
    "text_36": "2. Help customers master the product",
    "text_37": "For every enthusiastic customer who will do everything possible to improve their product-using skills and take full advantage of the self-service provided by the enterprise (in educational theory, they are called \"hunters\"), there are some who are less likely to go on their own Seek out this knowledge (in educational theory they are called \"herbivores\"). Unlike hunters, they rely on the information they are \"fed\" to improve their skills on a specific topic - such as a company's products.",
    "text_38": "Be proactive in teaching your customers how to use your product properly, and over time, they'll start to master it. This mastery breeds customer loyalty, making education an extremely important customer retention strategy. Customer success starts with their login process. The deep knowledge they gain enables them to be significantly more efficient in using the product. Once they master this, it becomes more expensive for them to replace the product, making customer churn much less likely.",
    "text_39": "3. Embed the company‚Äôs products into their workflows",
    "text_40": "Facebook. Twitter. Google. Slack. These companies all have one thing in common ‚Äì they create habits among their customers. So, how do you create customer habits in your own products? If your product has a browser extension, desktop app, or mobile app, promote it via out-of-app push, email, SMS, or in-app messaging, and make sure it's easy to add and use.",
    "text_41": "By letting new customers integrate your products across multiple platforms, you increase the likelihood that your products will become a recurring part of their lives. For example, new Dropbox users who fail to install the mobile app won't experience the full value of accessing their files from anywhere. Customers will upload fewer files, use less space, and therefore be less likely to pay more for storage.",
    "text_42": "4. Embed the company‚Äôs products into their organization",
    "text_43": "Encouraging new customers to establish shared connections in your software is one of the best ways to make your products churn-resistant, especially for products based on team collaboration. By embedding a company's products deeply into a company's workflow, the products become an integral part of how those companies operate and produce results, making product removal costly.",
    "text_44": "‚ÄúBy making their workflows more seamless and efficient, customers can spend less time switching between applications and enjoy stress-free work.‚Äù",
    "text_45": "It‚Äôs important to know when to bring people on board. Only when new customers reach a milestone or demonstrate that they are sufficiently engaged with your product (e.g., used a feature X number of times, imported custom data, etc.) should you ask them to invite their colleagues or teammates. Making such a heavy ‚Äúask‚Äù too early in the relationship will likely mean your request will be ignored.",
    "text_46": "What about another way to embed your product into your customer‚Äôs organization? Encourage them to integrate the company's products with other tools they use every day. By making their workflows more seamless and efficient, customers can spend less time switching between applications and enjoy stress-free work.",
    "text_47": "5. Inspire them with new features",
    "text_48": "Customers will not forget to use the company's product, they will lose interest in it. So companies must motivate customers. By giving customers a preview of upcoming products, businesses can get them excited about future releases. What motivates people to stick with it is usually features that save time (such as better imports), increase adoption or efficiency (such as integrating with third parties), or provide additional value without extra work (such as weekly reporting).",
    "text_49": "\"Try flagging feature requests so that when the feature is released, it's easy to send customers personalized, relevant information.\"",
    "text_50": "The best retention message we‚Äôve seen, sent to customers who have been inactive for the past 30 days, is an email listing all the features that have been added in the past 30 days. This ensures that it's always telling people about features they haven't heard of. What's more, it follows a key rule of customer communication: Don't tell people what to do, but inspire them to do it. Proper incentives are an underrated but crucial customer retention strategy.",
    "text_51": "Another helpful tip: Try tagging feature requests so that when the feature is released, it's easy to send customers personalized, relevant information. This shows that the business is paying attention to their customers‚Äô needs and making sure they don‚Äôt miss out on opportunities to address them.",
    "text_52": "6. Reactivate sleeping clients",
    "text_53": "Don‚Äôt take inactivity as a sign that people have permanently lost interest. Especially in those critical early days, when usage habits are not yet firmly established, there are many distractions when using enterprise products.",
    "text_54": "Businesses can offer one-time deals or wait for a big product or company announcement to try to re-engage customers. But even if you're still months away from the next big feature release, or have nothing new to show off, you can still offer valuable material to dormant customers, such as educational content like books, or paid Content research.",

    "text_55": "Some efforts are strategic and related to specific tactics. Others are more like values ‚Äã‚Äãthat businesses can ingrain into their organizations to improve customer retention and satisfaction across the board.",
    "text_56": "1. Understand the situation of product inactivity",
    "text_57": "For products like instant messaging, it is recommended to message customers after 30 days of inactivity. But first, companies should consider what inactive customers mean to the company. For example, 7 days of inactivity is concerning for a daily planning application. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo my customers need to be engaged daily, weekly, or monthly to be considered an active customer?‚Äù",
    "text_58": "No matter what ‚Äúinactivity‚Äù looks like, you can set triggers to ensure relevant, targeted messages are sent during these key moments. These messages can help people return to the app or product before it's too late.",
    "text_59": "2. Use messaging early",
    "text_60": "Our goal should be to connect with customers at the right time, in the right place, with the right information. But while we firmly believe that contextual messaging is the most effective way to engage customers, we also know that for new customers, enterprise applications may not become a core part of their daily lives overnight.",
    "text_61": "‚ÄúWhen messages are part of a carefully planned multi-channel campaign, these messages can serve as a jumping off point and keep customers coming back to your app or product‚Äù",
    "text_62": "If you notice that a customer has been inactive for a period of time during those very important days, you can use various messages to directly connect to the actions that your customer has taken (or not taken), thus serving as a platform for your product. extension effect. This means businesses can reach people with relevant, personalized messages to create a consistent, unified customer journey across channels. When used as part of a carefully curated multi-channel campaign, these messages can serve as a jumping off point and bring customers back to your app or product ‚Äì where you can help your customers gain more real-time value.",
    "text_63": "3. Target the right customers",
    "text_64": "Retention is not exactly the same. There's a difference between a customer who doesn't convert after a 30-day trial and a customer who's been inactive for a year. Trial customers may need more education about the product's value, while lapsed customers may need more contact to understand their specific reasons (such as sending a survey or scheduling a call with an account manager). Instead of reaching them with a uniform ‚Äúwe miss you,‚Äù treat them differently.",
    "text_65": "4. Be individual",
    "text_66": "Retained messages only work if they are accurate. For example, if you're talking to a high-value VIP customer who has contacted customer support multiple times this month, your message must reflect that. Don‚Äôt give answers to several open-ended customer support questions to remind them to log in, and don‚Äôt start with ‚ÄúDear Customer.‚Äù These non-personalized interactions are noticed by customers and slowly add up, eventually leading to decreased customer loyalty and poor customer relationships.",
    "text_67": "5. Gratitude, honesty, respect",
    "text_68": "A certain amount of customer churn is natural. Business comes and goes, and so does the demand for a company's products. When a customer decides to leave, make sure they leave on good terms. If they have legitimate questions about the company's products, acknowledge them. Thank the corporate guests and let them go. The easiest way to screw up is to continue spamming someone months or years after they‚Äôve left. This can do more harm than good.",
    "title_08": "The bottom line is...",
    "text_69": "If you want to ensure a sustainable, resilient business that can weather the storms of economic uncertainty, you should follow some of the customer retention strategies and best practices outlined above before it's too late. Involving your business's customers is the most reliable and impactful method. As long as the customer churn rate is reduced by 1%, the company's profits can be greatly improved.",
    "text_70": "Focusing on customer lifetime value and retention may not be as exciting as acquiring new customers or acquiring other businesses, but it is a more effective long-term approach. Take customer retention and customer loyalty seriously, and both businesses and customers will reap rewards for years to come."
